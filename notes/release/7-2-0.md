# Release notes for Inweb v7.2.0

This release was made in August 2022, and was the first proper release for major
version 7. This release is the baseline for Inweb release notes from here on.

The prerelease version [v7.1.0](7-1-0.md), a stopgap during the period when
Inform's open-sourcing was getting going, is substantially the same program.
However, 7.2.0 corrects a few bugs, and the `foundation` library added a number
of useful functions, notably to do with JSON file parsing and validation.
