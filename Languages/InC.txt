# The "shebang" routine for a language is called to add anything it wants to
# at the very top of the tangled code. (For a scripting language such as
# Perl or Python, that might be a shebang: hence the name.)
# But we will use it to defime the constant PLATFORM_POSIX everywhere except
# Windows. This needs to happen right at the top, because the "very early
# code" in a tangle may contain material conditional on whether it is defined.

Shebang: #ifndef PLATFORM_WINDOWS\n#define PLATFORM_POSIX\n#endif\n
