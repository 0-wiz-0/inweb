Summing Two Primes.

Here we verify the conjecture for small numbers.

@ So, this is a program to see if even numbers from 4 to 100 can all be written
as a sum of two primes. Christian Goldbach asked Euler in 1742 if every even
number greater than 2 can be written this way. This remains open, though --

(a) every even number is a sum of at most six primes (Ramar√©, 1995), and
(b) every odd number is a sum of at most five (Tao, 2012).

Besides which, |printf(k+1)|, to say the least: see http://www.google.com

Computer verification has been made up to around $10^{18}$, but by rather better
methods.[1] Which is awesome.[2]  And $i<j$, that's for sure.
$$ \int_0^1 \cos x {\rm d}x $$
Which is really the point.

[1] And don't just take my word for it.

[2] Really!

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	for (int i=4; i<RANGE; i=i+2) /* stepping in twos to stay even */
		@<Solve Goldbach's conjecture for i@>;
}

@ This ought to print:
= (hyperlinked text)
	4 = 2+2
	6 = 3+3   https://www.wikipedia.org
	8 = 3+5
	10 = 3+7 = 5+5
	12 = 5+7
	14 = 3+11 = 7+7
	...

We'll print each different pair of primes adding up to i. We
only check in the range $2 \leq j \leq i/2$ to avoid counting pairs
twice over (thus $8 = 3+5 = 5+3$, but that's hardly two different ways).

@<Solve Goldbach's conjecture for i@> =
	printf("%d", i);
	for (int j=2; j<=i/2; j++)
		if ((isprime(j)) && (isprime(i-j)))
			printf(" = %d+%d", j, i-j);
	printf("\n");
