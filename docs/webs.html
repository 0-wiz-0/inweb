This GitHub project was written as a literate program, powered by a LP tool
called Inweb. While almost all programs at Github are open to inspection, most
are difficult for new readers to navigate, and are not structured for extended
reading. By contrast, a "web" (the term goes back to Knuth: see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Wikipedia</a>)
is designed to be read by humans in its "woven" form, and to be compiled or
run by computers in its "tangled" form.
These pages showcase the woven form, and are for human eyes only.</p>
